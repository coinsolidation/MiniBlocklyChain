The opensource version of Mini BlocklyChain, is a blockchain based on Blockly programming for App Inventor and others blockly systems. Information is available at languages ​​(Spanish, English, Chinese, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Dutch and Portuguese).

Mini BlocklyChain is a fully functional blockchain is a technology developed for mobile phones with OS (Operating System) Android that will be the nodes that will perform in sending and receiving transactions. We created the first blockchain technology that is structured in a "modular" way through Blockly programming where anyone with minimal knowledge and without knowing how to program can create and develop programs for mobile phones and create their own blockchain either in public or private network mode. If you want to create your own digital currency you can do it or a solution to use it in a company, the possibilities are based on the needs of each real case and the business logic that the user adopts or creates according to his requirements.

Mini BlocklyChain is the first modular blockchain for mobile phones where a transactional system can be implemented in a short time.

Before entering the definition and use of "module" blocks we need to have the basic concepts of the Mini BlocklyChain components to know when, how and where to apply them according to the real case we want to implement.
The following concepts emphasize what type of user they are targeting, so it is not important for people who do not have programming skills that the concepts for development users are fully understood. 

To review the way of use, there is a user manual created to implement a blockchain system from scratch.

The manuals are found in the "HandBooks" directory in the following languages ​​(Spanish, English, Chinese, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Dutch and Portuguese).

Extensions are found in the "Extensions" directory which are described in detail in the user manual.

The diffrent extensiond that provide us with levels of security to save, validate and transfer transactions from the Mini BlocklyChain network nodes.

The security blocks are based on the following extensions:

I.	  OpenQbitAESEncryption extension.

II.	  OpenQbitAESDecryption extension.

III.	OpenQbitAEStoString extension.

IV.	  OpenQbitEncDecData extension.

V.	  OpenQbitFileHash extension.

VI.	  OpenQbitRSA extension.

VII.	OpenQbitSSHClient extension.

VIII.	OpenQbitStringHash extension.

IX.	  OpenSQLite extension.

X.    OpenQbitBlock extension.
